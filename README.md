# CmdLineMat

So this will currently work on OS X only.
The CmdLine args package is in CmdArgs and 
should be built/installed so that this 
exec can link it. 


Once CmdArgs is built, you can run 
```bash
make
```
and you'll get the exe. 
You can set quite a few parameters from the
command line. To write a log of all the 
output use the -log xxx name. The extension
will be a .csv but you can change it if you
like within the source code.
